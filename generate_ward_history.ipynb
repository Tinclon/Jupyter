    "Maple Leaf Ward—Brief Narrative\n",
    "Stake Leadership Training: Ward priesthood and auxiliary leaders were invited to attend training at the Toronto Ontario Central Stake Center. Executive secretaries and ward clerks were also invited to attend. The meeting was held on January 15, 2012. The messages shared by the speakers centered around the strengthening of families, increasing temple attendance, and a renewed focus on missionary work.\n",
    "Family History Center: An open house was held on February 25th at the family history center, which is in the Maple Leaf Ward meetinghouse. As part of the goals set for 2012, members of the Maple Leaf Ward strived to utilize the resources in the family history center. Members increased in their knowledge and appreciation of family research, and local nonmember participation was also carried out. Through this effort, over 200 names have been submitted for temple work or taken by members to the temple to perform the ordinances for them.\n",
    "Ward Temple Night: The first ward temple night of the year was made to the Toronto Temple on March 15. We were happy to see that Harold and Arlene Davies received their endowments. They were sealed, and then their daughter Elena was sealed to them. Thomas Jameson also came with the ward and received his own endowment and was sealed to his parents, who are deceased. Several members of the ward had been fellowshipping the Davies family over the last year, so there was a lot of excitement and joy because of this event. We’ve seen a renewed emphasis on going to the temple carried on throughout the year.\n",

    "Bishopric Changes: On April 15th, the bishopric went through a change in counselors. The first counselor, George Rivers, was called to serve in the Canada Toronto Mission presidency. After serving for 4 years in the bishopric and being such an active advocate for missionary work in the ward, Brother Rivers will be a great addition to the work of the Canada Toronto Mission. Called to replace him was James Shumway. Brother Shumway has experience serving as the High Priest Group Leader and, most recently, was a member of the Toronto Ontario Central Stake High Council.\n",

    "Father and Son Campout: On May 25–26 there was a campout for the men, young men, and boys in the ward. The elders quorum organized the event, which took place at the Cedar Flats campground near Scanlon Creek, Ontario. It was a great success as several inactive men in the ward took the opportunity to take their boys camping and became better acquainted with other members of the quorum. And their sons were able to meet the boys their age in the ward. Two of these fathers have been bringing their families to church on Sunday more often since the campout. The young men were responsible for the breakfast on Saturday morning and learned some things about preparing food. The highlight of the campout was a zip line that Terry Vaughan, elders quorum president, set up.\n",

    "Young Women Camp: The Young Women in the ward joined with the young women of the Toronto Ontario Central Stake for Young Women camp on June 12–15. The camp took place at Oakridge Ranch, a Church‐owned property near Walker Woods, Ontario, that includes cabins, a new kitchen and dining hall, as well as a new restroom and shower facility (recently renovated to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Young Women camp). This was a great opportunity for the Young Women to get out of the city and experience being in the wilderness. They also learned leadership skills and fellowshipping. Several of the less active girls in the ward were invited to attend. The Young Women report that the highlight of camp was the testimony meeting that was held the last night of the camp.\n",

    "Ward Conference: The Maple Leaf Ward conference was held on August 5, 2012. The stake president, Sherman Benson, presided over the meeting. Stephen Goudy, second counselor in the stake presidency, and Bishop Matthew Roberts each spoke during the conference. Bishop Roberts expressed much appreciation for the prayers of the ward in his behalf and for the support of Sister Roberts that help him to keep up with the demands of his calling. He said he is very encouraged by the efforts of the ward members to strengthen families in the ward and increase their temple attendance and by their renewed excitement for missionary work.\n",
    "Convert Baptisms: The Markham family was baptized on September 8 and then confirmed members of the Church in sacrament meeting on Sunday, September 9. Those baptized and confirmed were the father and mother, Milton and Lori Markham, their son Oliver Markham (14), and their son Colin Markham (11). Milton and Lori also have a son, Danny (5), who is a welcome addition to the Primary.\n",
    "The baptism was attended by nearly the whole ward, and the Spirit was very strong. The sacrament meeting the next day was one of the most spiritual events of the year for the ward. An outpouring of love and gratitude was felt by all, and many tears of joy were shed. This experience has inspired many members of the ward to pray for missionary experiences, and we regularly see nonmember youth and adults invited to ward gatherings and activities.\n",

    "Service Project. Hurricane Zachary, a late‐season storm, struck the New England area on September 23, affecting parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. There was a great need for hygiene kits in the affected areas. The Maple Leaf Ward Relief Society organized a project to collect and package items for the needed hygiene kits. On September 28, we were able to donate over 200 kits to the Red Cross.\n",

    "Area Basketball Championship: The young men of the Maple Leaf Ward participated in Church basketball throughout the fall. The team had the good fortune of having several boys in the priests quorum who have played together for the past several years. This turned out to be their year, as they came victorious through the stake and regional tournaments. The area tournament was played in Rochester, New York, over two days, November 17–18. The competition was tough, but the Maple Leaf team made it to the championship game and won a close one. The bishop congratulated the boys on their accomplishment on the court but said he was even more pleased with how close they had grown through the season as a quorum. He was also pleased that they used the opportunity to fellowship some of the less active boys and to invite their nonmember friends to participate.\n",

    "“Bring These, Our Brethren, Again unto Thee” Maple Leaf Ward Conference Talk (August 5, 2012)\n",
    "Alma 31:35 “Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.”\n",
    "The setting for this scripture: The people were noted for their costly apparel, for their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold. Their hearts were set upon the things of this world. Sometimes there was a little pride, then pride increased, and finally the people were waxed in pride. They sometimes thought they were better than other people. Their prayers were like this: “We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish” (Alma 31:28). They rejected the coming of Christ.\n",
    "Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah were brilliant young men. They thought they were wiser than their elders and went about, puffed up with pride, leading people astray. They were rebellious. They were sinners. Alma Sr. prayed for his son and the sons of Mosiah. The members of the Church prayed for these young men. Alma tells us in his own words:\n",
    "Alma 36:6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.\n",
    "7 . . . he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.\n",
    "10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.\n",
    "12 . . . I was racked with eternal torment. . . . My soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.\n",
    "13...Ididrememberallmysinsandiniquities....Iwastormentedwiththepainsofhell....IsawthatIhad rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.\n",
    "14 . . . I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; . . . so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.\n",
    "17 . . . As I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\n",
    "18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.\n",
    "19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.\n",
    "20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!\n",
    "21 . . . There could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again . . . on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.\n",
    "19\n",
    "\n",
    "Alma and the sons of Mosiah were born again. They were converted to the gospel. The atonement became operative in their lives. Alma was offered the opportunity to become the chief judge and chief (presiding) high priest. He chose to serve as the presiding high priest and to bring souls unto Christ. In Alma 29 we read these words:\n",
    "1 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\n",
    "2 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.\n",
    "How Did They Serve?\n",
    "Alma and the sons of Mosiah had a mighty change of heart. They were now humble. They did not try to cover up their past. They looked for opportunities to serve. They were no longer puffed up with pride. They looked upon every soul as being of great worth and equal in the eyes of God. They remembered the scripture:\n",
    "He inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile(2 Nephi 26:33).\n",
    "They continued to bring souls unto Christ for the rest of their lives.\n",
    "How does this background from the Book of Mormon relate to us today? I see parallels. We are surrounded by evil. We see good being called evil and evil being called good. We see the great sin of pride among us. We see court challenges carefully and skillfully crafted to change eternal truths of the gospel.\n",
    "What is our collective challenge in this regard?\n",
    "For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God (Alma 36:26).\n",
    "What is my personal challenge?\n",
    "I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me. And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him (Alma 36:24, 27–28).\n",
    "The challenge has been issued for us to first come unto Christ ourselves as did Alma and the sons of Mosiah and then help bring those around us to Christ.\n",
    "My personal challenge: I am your bishop. The buck stops here. Many things are placed on my plate. I am humbled and overwhelmed at the responsibilities placed on my shoulders. I know that I am far from perfect. I know that on my own I am nothing and I can do nothing. I need guidance from above.\n",

    "MAPLE LEAF WARD High Priests Group History\n",
    "A new high priests group leadership of the Maple Leaf Ward, Toronto Ontario Central Stake, was sustained on Sunday, September 16, 2012. Sustained as group leader was Kelly Pringle, with Don L. Barnes as first assistant and Mason Kimball as second assistant. Those released were Richard Gilmour as group leader, Kelly Pringle as first assistant, and Eric Kohler as second assistant.\n",
    "The new group leadership members are longtime residents of the Maple Leaf Ward—their tenure over 80 years of combined service. Brother Pringle and his family live on First Avenue, have five children, and moved into the ward in 1980 when they purchased their home. The Pringles’ youngest son, Patrick, is currently serving in the Switzerland Zurich Mission. Brother Barnes and his wife, Donna, have lived in the ward over 23 years, having sold their photography business on First Avenue and served a mission to the California Oakland Mission, and now reside in the Vineyard Towers on South York Ave. Brother Kimball and his family moved into the ward in 1971 and have six children. Their youngest son, Russell, currently serves in the Brazil Belo Horizonte Mission.\n",
    "The theme chosen by the leadership group comes from the New Testament in Luke 22:32, when the Savior admonishes Peter, “And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” The first Sunday lessons by the group leadership will echo this theme and encourage the members of the group to “follow the Brethren.”\n",
    "The group is instructed by Larry Perkins and Theo Heath, who alternate teaching weeks and teach material from the priesthood lesson manual as well as from the Teachings for Our Time curriculum.\n",
    "The group members home teach over 100 families, many of whom are widows and widowers, and several less active members. The brethren are very faithful and anxious to help where needed. The last few months, several high priest brethren and their families have moved into the ward, and several have moved out. The brethren have rallied together and given assistance with vehicles and manpower when needed.\n",
    "At the start of this new year, the high priests group of the Maple Leaf Ward looks for an increased level of activity and spirituality.\n",

    "Primary Maple Leaf Ward 2012 History\n",
    "Emphasis: The theme for Primary this year was “Choose the Right.” Lessons were developed to teach and explain the structure of the Church and what it means to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints. Notable lessons included discussions on the children’s relationship with God, lessons about the opportunities to choose the right anytime, and explaining the two covenants we make during the sacrament.\n",
    "Particular struggles: Efforts to create a reverent environment were a struggle due to age, but efforts to engage the children were made by both the presidency and the sharing time specialist, Rod Hester.\n",
    "Particular efforts or events: Celeste Johnson made a strong effort to not only make a contact but to build a relationship with Marley Gillaland, an inactive Valiant. Susan and Doug Lynch also made a particular effort to contact Nadia Iler, one of their Sunbeams. Leslie Edwards, a CTR 1, moved out of the ward. However, her grandmother, Connie Mason, reported that she continues to talk about church and sing the primary songs.\n",
    "Jonah Forsburg was the one member added to our Primary after the boundaries changed.\n",
    "We were also very pleased to welcome Colin (age 11) and Danny (age 5) Markham to the Primary. Their family joined the Church on September 8.\n",
    "Notable releases include:\n",
    "Merrilee Hillam was released as a second counselor in the Primary presidency in January. Stacie Hymas, pianist and Amber Kynaston, chorister, were both released during the first part of the summer. LaRue Rassmussen, pianist, was released in the early part of October, as well as Mitch and Becca Snyder, all of whom had served for a number of years in the Primary. Lacey Valley, CTR 1 teacher, and Bonnie Young, nursery leader, were released in late October due to the ward and stake boundary changes.\n",
    "Notable callings include:\n",
    "In January, Carol Tyrrell was called to be the second counselor, and Laura Maldado was called to be secretary in the Primary presidency. April Moncrief was called to be the Primary chorister in August, Heidi Brost was called to be the nursery leader, and Mary Rozell was called in November to be the pianist.\n",
    "Activities Include:\n",
    "On June 22, we held a Primary service project. On October 30, the children came to the ward house dressed as pirates and ghosts to celebrate Halloween.\n",
    "The Primary Program:\n",
    "On October 27, we had the Primary program. Focusing on the year’s theme, the children sang “I Am a Child of God,” “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints,” “On a Golden Springtime,” “I Lived in Heaven,” “Keep the Commandments,” and “Choose the Right Way.” The children drew pictures of particular gospel topics, holding them up; they explained the doctrine they had learned.\n",

    "Ward Missionary History\n",
    "We have had great experiences as ward missionaries this year. There are several less- active people that we are currently working with and having some good results with. We have been out knocking doors of both the less-active and nonmembers to see if they would be interested. The fruits of our labors have been great this year! We worked with the full-time missionaries to teach and baptize the Markham family during the summer, and later in the year we began working with two more good investigators who are receptive and have been taking the discussions regularly.\n",
    "The highlight of the year was the baptism of the Markham family. Four members of the family were baptized on September 8 and then confirmed members of the Church in sacrament meeting on Sunday, September 9. Those baptized and confirmed were the father and mother, Milton and Lori Markham, and their sons Oliver Markham (14) and Colin Markham (11). The Markham’s youngest son, Danny (5), is a welcome addition to our Primary. The baptism was attended by nearly the whole ward, and the Spirit was very strong.\n",
    "At one point during the year, we had seven ward missionaries, but they have either moved or been released and placed in other callings. Currently, A. J. Gresko, Pauline Powell, and myself are the only ones left, but we anticipate more shortly. Daniel and Kelly Barca were with us until Daniel was called into the elders quorum presidency for a short time before they moved. Michael and Tera Whitcomb were also with us until Michael was called into the elders quorum presidency. A. J. Gresko will no longer be with us on a full-time basis due to his recent move to Hamilton to experience college life with other college students.\n",
    "We have had much success when the ward has rallied around an event such as the ward fair or Christmas party and invited other people that we normally don’t see at church to come have fun and eat food with us. We are currently working on some ideas for the future but have not worked out all the details yet. The missionaries that cover our ward have also been very kind and supportive.\n",

    "Member Accounts\n",
    "Sister Lori Markham offered the following account of her family’s spiritual experience related to their conversion and joining the Church this year:\n",
    "My name is Lori Markham, and I would like to bear my testimony and share my family’s feelings of gratitude and joy for the best thing that’s ever happened to us. We, the Markham family, took the missionary discussions during the summer and were converted to the Church. It took us a little while to come to it, but we decided to join the Church. Probably a better way to put it is that we came to know that the Lord wanted us to join His Church. We were baptized at the stake center on December 8 and confirmed in the Maple Leaf Ward chapel on December 9. All this has started us on a new path in life and brought us so much happiness. I know this is just the beginning of a lifetime of blessings and great experiences.\n",
    "We were so amazed to see so many members of the ward there to support us at the baptism and to share in the experience. Ever since we started coming to church in July, we have felt so welcomed and loved by the ward members. We should especially mention Elders Wolfley and Nilsson, who knocked on our door on July 6, 2012 and asked if they could share a message of the Saviour with us. That’s where it all started, but there were others who taught us and fellowshipped us along the way: A. J. Gresko, who so lovingly taught the Gospel Principles Sunday School class every Sunday, and the Whitcombs and the Barcas, who often came to our house with the missionaries to teach the discussions.\n",
    "We learned so many things from this experience, but a couple of the highlights are that the Lord’s Church is truly like a family who seeks after the spiritual welfare of their brothers and sisters. And the hand of the Lord is plainly evident in our lives. He prepared us for this time in our lives in thousands of little ways over the years.\n",
    "I am speaking for myself and for my husband and children when I say that we know this is the true church. We know that Joseph Smith is truly the prophet of God who translated the Book of Mormon and organized the restored Church under the Lord’s direction. We are led by a prophet today, and the priesthood of God is on the earth again. We are looking forward to the day when we can go to the temple and be sealed as a family by the power of that priesthood. I say this in the name of the Jesus Christ, amen.\n",

    "Sister Lila Chlarson submitted the following account from her son, Bryce Chlarson, who is currently serving in the Air Force:\n",
    "Sometimes it’s important to just step back and put things into the right perspective and recognize the hand of God in our lives. As someone who has traveled to many far‐flung regions of the world as a U.S. Air Force pilot, I have witnessed firsthand the enormous inequities that exist in this world. I often wonder why so many come into this world in such desperate circumstances, while so many others, myself included, are born into a free and prosperous nation where, by comparison, even the poorest among us is wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of countless millions in the other regions. Rich not only in material things, but rich in freedom and opportunity.\n",
    "Of course, that very freedom and prosperity that we enjoy (and unfortunately often take for granted) does not merely happen by accident. Countless numbers of men and women have fought and sacrificed all to grant us that freedom.\n",
    "I fly the C‐5 Galaxy, the largest transport in the Air Force and one of the largest in the world. It is a tremendous boost to the morale of our soldiers on the ground in Iraq to see the tail of a C‐5 parked on the ramp, because they know that their much‐needed supplies have arrived. At a recent briefing given to the base leadership at Dover AFB, a soldier returning from the theater explained this impact on the troops. He said that every time a C‐ 5 mission does not make it into a downrange airfield, a convoy of 250‐plus personnel has to be assembled to convoy to Baghdad to get resupplied. On average, they will lose two soldiers to enemy fire during that round trip. He told the wing commander that every C‐5 that lands in theater saves two lives, and hence the absolute critical nature of our mission.\n",
    "Well, it's easy to get distracted from that when you’re safe at home, far away from the conflict. Just last week I had just such a day. Our crew was alerted to fly a mission out of Dover AFB to take cargo overseas which was bound for Iraq. We showed up at the aircraft on a hot and steamy Sunday afternoon to prepare the jet for takeoff. The temperature outside was over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with probably close to 90% humidity as well. The C‐ 5 was originally built in the late ’60s and early ’70s, and although it is a highly capable aircraft with lots of service life left, it does show its age on occasion. Large enough to accommodate seven fully assembled UH‐1 helicopters plus passengers, it is literally a flying building.\n",
    "On this day, the crew and ground maintenance personnel worked feverishly to get the aircraft ready for departure but ran into one problem after another. The air conditioning system on this particular aircraft was not working properly, and as a consequence the temperature on the flight deck was well over 100 degrees, and up to 120 degrees in certain compartments. As a result, numerous electronic malfunctions kept cropping up, likely due to overheating of the equipment.\n",
    "After only 20 minutes on the aircraft, everyone was soaked through their flight suits with sweat. The crew of a dozen plus probably the same number of maintenance personnel worked diligently in the intense heat to try and correct the numerous problems for over 7 hours, getting more and more frustrated as time went by. The flight crew is not allowed to pound the ramp indefinitely when problems like this occur, else they run the risk of becoming too fatigued to operate the aircraft safely. And so, when the aircraft was still not close to . . .\n",

    "Combined Maple Leaf Ward and West York First Ward Activity TALENT SHOW\n",
    "On June 22, 2012, under the direction of Clara Johnson and Linda Ricks, the Maple Leaf Ward and West York First Ward of the Toronto Ontario Central Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints staged a talent show at the Hendricks Street chapel. The theme of the show was inspired by Shakespeare: “O brother, O sister, wherefore art thy talents?” (Romeo and Juliet). Posters were displayed in both foyers of the church building during the weeks preceding the show. Also, signup sheets were distributed in priesthood and Relief Society during the four weeks prior asking members of the two wards to volunteer to share a performing or visual art or bring a dozen cookies. (Cookies and ice cream were served after the talent show was over.)\n",
    "On the day of the show, the West York First Ward members set up the refreshment table and the chairs for the audience. The Maple Leaf Ward prepared the stage and sound system (Nardine Jentzch and Brant Peterson) and the art display tables (Clara Johnson). Refreshments were provided by both wards, with Linda Ricks and Carole Bales overseeing their preparations. The talent show was slated to start at 7 p.m. but began at approximately 7:15 p.m. The MCs for the evening event were Rob Hales (Jim Hales’s son) and Trent Bastien. Although they both said they were nervous, the audience responded very well to Rob and Trent’s first MC experience. The young men and young women from each ward provided intermediate skits between each of the performing arts and did a marvelous job. The skits were centered around the theme (chosen by the youth themselves) of “sweet summer.” The skits addressed everything from skateboarding and sleeping late to getting a driver’s license and going on vacation. The audience responded with a number of laughs.\n",

    "Regional Training Meeting: The branch president was invited to attend the regional training meeting with a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. District and branch clerks were also invited to attend. The meeting was held on 15 January in Guatemala City at a special sacrament meeting.\n",
    "The messages shared by the speakers centered largely on the strengthening of families. (President Escobar shared these same messages at a special training meeting for priesthood and auxiliary leaders in the branch on 4 March.)\n",
    "Family History Center: An open house was held on February 25 at the Belize City family history center, which is in the Belize City East Branch meetinghouse. As part of the goals set for 2012, the Church in Belize City encouraged members to utilize the resources in the family history center. Members increased in their knowledge and appreciation of family research, and local nonmembers also participated. Through this effort, over 50 names were submitted for temple work or taken by members to the temple to perform the ordinances for them.\n",
    "Unfortunately, on 11 August 2012, the family history center was broken into. The burglars were interrupted in the act and fled the scene without taking anything, but it was clear that measures needed to be taken to make the center more secure. The equipment was moved to a secure location, and the family history center has been closed temporarily. It is expected to open again in January after reinforcements to the building are completed.\n",
    "Temple Trip: A temple trip was made to the Merida Mexico Temple March 15–17. It was planned for members of the branch ready to receive their own endowment. We were happy to see that Enrique and Sandra Betancourt received their endowments. They were sealed on the 16th. Thomaso Jimenez also made the trip and received his own endowment and was sealed to his parents, who are deceased. Several members of the branch had been fellowshipping the Betancourts over the last year, so there was a lot of excitement and joy because of this event. We’ve seen a renewed emphasis in the branch on temple attendance as a result of this inspiring achievement.\n",
    "Branch Presidency: On April 15, the branch presidency went through a change in counselors. The second counselor, Jorge Rivero, was called to serve in the mission presidency. After serving for 5 years in the branch presidency and being such an active advocate for missionary work in the branch, Brother Rivero will be a great addition to the work of the Belize Belize City Mission.\n",
    "Called to replace him was Jose Donis. Brother Donis has experience serving as a branch clerk and, most recently, as a member of the Belize district council.\n",
    "Father and Son Campout: On May 25–26 there was a campout for the men, young men, and boys in the branch. The priesthood group organized the event, which took place at the Crooked Tree campground near Western Lagoon. It was a great success, as several inactive men in the branch took the opportunity to take their boys camping and became better acquainted with other members of the quorum and their sons were able to meet the boys their age in the branch. Two of these fathers have been bringing their families to church more often since the campout. The young men were responsible for the breakfast on Saturday morning and learned some things about preparing food. But for many of the boys, the highlight of the campout was riding the zip line that runs across the campground.\n",

    "Mission Presidency: President Benicio Olivera completed his mission in June 2012 and returned to his native El Salvador. President Clyde Washburn was welcomed as the new mission president, along with his wife, in their visit to Belize City in July. President and Sister Washburn are from Waco, Texas, where President Washburn taught medicine at Baylor University.\n",
    "Young Women Camp: The young women in the branch joined with the young women of the Belize District for Young Women camp on June 12–15. The camp took place at Mountain Pine Ranch, a Church-owned property that includes cabins, a new kitchen and dining hall, as well as a new restroom and shower facility (recently renovated to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Young Women camp). This was a great opportunity for the young women to get out of the city and experience being in the wilderness. They also learned leadership skills and fellowshipping. Several of the less active girls in the branch were convinced to attend. One of the young women even brought a nonmember friend, Olivia Fabers, whose family ended up taking the missionary discussions and joining the Church. The young women report that the highlight of camp was the testimony meeting on the last night of the camp.\n",
    "Branch Conference: The Belize City East Branch Conference was held on 5 August 2012. The district president, Rene Alvarado, presided over the meeting. Israel Munoz, second counselor in the district presidency, and Luis Escobar, branch president, each spoke during the conference. President Escobar expressed much appreciation for the prayers of the branch in his behalf and for the support of Sister Escobar that help him to keep up with the demands of his calling. He said is very encouraged by the efforts of the branch members in strengthening their own families and in strengthening the branch family.\n",
    "New Missionary Couple. On August 25 Elder and Sister Little, who had served as missionaries in Belize City since late 2010, went home. They left behind many grateful memories of their time and efforts in Belize City. We are grateful for the sacrifices that they made to share their talents and gifts to help establish the cause of Zion in Belize. We welcomed Elder and Sister Wolstenhume on August 30 as the new missionary couple assigned to serve in Belize City.\n",
    "Convert Baptisms: On September 8, the Fabers family was baptized and then confirmed members of the Church in sacrament meeting on Sunday, September 9. Those baptized and confirmed were the father and mother, Ricardo and Andrea Fabers, their daughter Olivia Fabers (14), and their son Ricardo Fabers Jr. (11). Ricardo and Andrea also have a younger daughter, Victoria (7), and a son, Roberto (5), who are a welcome addition to the Primary.\n",
    "The baptism was attended by nearly the whole branch, and the Spirit was very strong. The sacrament meeting the next day was one of the most spiritual events of the year for the branch. An outpouring of love and gratitude was felt by all, and many tears of joy were shed.\n",
    "Service Project. Hurricane Yelda, a late-season storm, struck just south of Belize on September 23, affecting parts of Honduras and Guatemala. There was a great need for hygiene kits in the affected areas. Belize City was not affected, but the Belize City East Branch Relief Society organized a project to collect and package items for the needed hygiene kits. On September 28, we were able donate over 200 kits to the Church’s humanitarian efforts.\n",
